# Introduction    
This is the github repository for our shared LaTeX report for Thermal Physics EaRL Spring 2026.  You can use whatever you want to compile the LaTeX code on your machine (I use vim + latexmk) and then push your changes to our document using any git compatible client. 

The report details the phenomenon of unexpected temperature change in entropic springs resulting from the first two laws of thermodynamics, records a series of lab observations of a rubber band's changing entropy and temperature, provides an explanation of theory and models to explain the observations, and then poses a series of questions and answers to provide further analysis of the systems under investigation.

For doing data analysis and plotting with the lab data: Priority for data format conversion, analysis, and plotting is Python; for heavy statistical analysis R is preferred.   Plots should be exported to the Image folder and referenced in the final LaTeX report.
